## How it works

### Resume

it search, catalog, delete and update movies, some of that actions needs a token, this token that is provided before login.

### Routes

#### User routes:
- **/users/:email** - returns username, email and hash md5 from email
- **/users/login** - validate email and password then returns token that expires in 24 hours;
- **/users/create** - creates account;
- **/users/validate/:token** - returns if token still valid;

#### Movie routes:
**_don't needS token: ðŸ”·_**

**_needs token: ðŸ”¶_**
